# What is this?

This is a small project that outputs the user's geolocation using a geolocation API. It was built in order to learn how to use and experiment with the geolocation API.

The user can simply load the page, accept geolocation permissions, and the user's geolocation (or more accurately, that of the machine) will be outputted.

#

I might add Google Maps integration in the future. We shall see.
